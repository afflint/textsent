The model should be good not only in predicting masked tokens, but also as pre-trained model for other tasks. The advantage of this procedure is that the Transformer encoder does not know which words it will be asked to predict or which have been replaced by random words, so it is forced to keep a distributional contextual representation of every input token.\n",
